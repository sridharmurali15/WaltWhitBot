# WaltWhitBot

Walt Whitman was one of the most influential poets of modern history.

I personally can't write good poetry.

So, I thought of building a machine learning model which reads in thousands of poems and helps me write one

-------

*bot_test.ipynb* is the notebook file where I analyzed the data and tested different architectures

*model_pkl_700_100_50k* is the fianl model built

*char_to_id-2.pkl* is the character to id vectorizer

*id_to_char-2.pkl* is the id to char vectorizer

*poem_ai.py* is the python script version of the testing notbeook. Running this script builds the 3 files mentioned above

*poem_ai_bot.py* is the script to use the built model and generate a poem in a bot-like fashion

-----

Walt WhitBot is not a fool proof. Due to computational constraints, only a mediocre Walt was built. I am positive that with more data and computational power, a better model can be built.
